Aiming to reduce the devastating consequences of road traffic accidents, this project employs machine learning to predict accident severity. The model, trained on data including vehicle type, casualty details,the type of the road, the location, and the weather at the time of the accident, just to mention a few, can be used to inform proactive strategies aimed at reducing fatalities and injuries.
